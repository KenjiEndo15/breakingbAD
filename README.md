## About breakingbAD
breakingbAD is a plateform for cybersecurity enthusiasts to conduct vulnerability research in an easy and fast way. The current laboratory is Active Directory oriented.

## Main credits
This project wouldn't exist without [GOAD (Game of Active Directory)](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD). My laboratory is heavily inspired by it (credits to [Mayfly](https://github.com/Mayfly277)) and I strongly recommend giving it a try.

## Documentation
See the [Wiki](https://github.com/KenjiEndo15/breakingbAD/wiki) (currently in the making) for full documentation, examples, tips, etc.
