ID01 | ESC8
===========
ESC stands for Escalation and is a misconfiguration on Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS).
It allows an individual in an AD setup to escalate their privilege.

ESC8 is well documented by Will Schroeder and Lee Christensen in their paper `Certified Pre-Owned`_.
It focuses on the web enrollment HTTP/S endpoint allowing users to retrieve certificates (for example to authenticate in AD).
