ID05 | IPv6
===========
IPv6 is enabled by default and takes precedence of IPv4 for its DHCP and DNS.
This allows poisoning of machines that look up for a DHCPv6 server
(by setting ourselves as the DHCPv6 server).

Table of availables actions, states, and targets
------------------------------------------------
.. list-table::

Launch
------
Enable
~~~~~~
.. code-block::

    # Current directory: ansible
    ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbooks/vulnerabilities/05.yml --extra-vars "action=enable"

Disable
~~~~~~~
.. code-block::

    # Current directory: ansible
    ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbooks/vulnerabilities/05.yml --extra-vars "action=disable"

Trigger
~~~~~~~
.. code-block::

    # Current directory: ansible
    ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbooks/vulnerabilities/05.yml --extra-vars "action=trigger"

.. tip::

  You may need to use this command multiple times if no poisoning is happening.

Implementation
--------------
Enable
~~~~~~
IPv6 is enabled by default.
To enable it back after disabling it, a set of firewall rules
are enabled and set to ``Allow``.

Reference:

* `05/enable/tasks/main.yml`_

Disable
~~~~~~~
A set of firewall rules are enabled and set to ``Block``.

**Reference**:

* `05/disable/tasks/main.yml`_

Trigger
~~~~~~~
The target machine is restarted so that an IPv6 lookup can be triggered.
A DHCPv6 server can then pick on any IPv6 solicitation.

**Note**: restarting the server is (for now) the most efficient way
I found to trigger IPv6 lookups.

**Reference**:

* `05/enable/tasks/main.yml`_

Customization
-------------
You can choose another target than the default one.

.. code-block::

    host_name = srv01 | srv02
    action = enable | disable | trigger

.. caution::

    Setting **dc01** in the ``host_name`` variable is not recommended
    as it's the domain controller, and may fail interesting attacks on IPv6.

Example with **srv01**:

.. code-block::

    # Current directory: ansible
    ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbooks/vulnerabilities/05.yml --extra-vars "action=trigger host_name=srv01"
